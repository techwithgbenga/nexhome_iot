# 🔌 NexHome IoT

**NexHome IoT** is an open-source, developer-friendly, and modular **IoT Device Management and Home Automation Hub** — built for the next generation of smart homes and connected environments. It’s designed to give users total control over their smart devices while providing developers with the tools to innovate, extend, and build on top of a scalable, privacy-focused automation platform.

> ⚙️ Automate smarter. Monitor better. Build freely.

## 🌟 Vision

Our vision is to build the **most flexible and future-proof open-source home and office automation system** — one that supports a wide range of IoT devices, offers both local and cloud control, and evolves with the help of a global community of contributors, developers, and hobbyists.

## 🚀 Project Goals

### ✅ Core Goals

- **Universal Device Integration**
  - Support for a wide range of IoT devices via modular plugins (Philips Hue, Nest, Sonoff, Shelly, etc.)
  - Unified API to abstract hardware/device-specific logic
  - Community-contributed device drivers

- **Flexible Automation Engine**
  - Visual builder and/or DSL (domain-specific language) for defining automation logic
  - Time-based, trigger-based, and condition-based automations
  - Rule versioning and rollback support

- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**
  - Web-based and mobile-responsive UI built with Next.js + TailwindCSS
  - Live device control, data charts (e.g. temperature, humidity), and alert system
  - Usage insights and history logs

- **Secure & Private by Design**
  - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Fully encrypted local storage and secure communication protocols
  - Local-first approach with optional cloud sync

- **Developer Platform**
  - REST & WebSocket APIs
  - MQTT Broker support
  - Plugin system for custom devices, automation logic, or dashboard widgets
  - CLI tools for managing, testing, and deploying modules

- **Local Edge Control**
  - Run on Raspberry Pi, Linux servers, or containers
  - Offline fallback and local-first sync
  - Optional cloud dashboard for remote access

## 🧠 Future Enhancements (Roadmap Ideas)

- ✅ App Store / Plugin Marketplace
- ✅ AI-assisted automations (e.g., auto-learn habits or energy savings)
- ✅ Voice assistant integration (Alexa, Google Home, Mycroft)
- ✅ Zigbee/Z-Wave bridge support
- ✅ Energy usage optimization dashboard
- ✅ Device presence detection and geofencing
- ✅ Mobile app companion (React Native or Flutter)
- ✅ Smart scenes, schedules, and vacation modes
- ✅ Multi-tenant support for shared/office environments
